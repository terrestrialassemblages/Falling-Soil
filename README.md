# Falling Sand Sim

A falling sand simulator used to emulate plant processes. This project was developed for Simon Ingram's Terrestrial Assemblages
as part of UoA's 2023 Summer Research Scholarship Program. Code was developed from a falling sand program found [here.](https://github.com/ObviousNonsense/FallingSand)

[You can play with my program here](https://rikkaly.github.io/FallingPlantCycle/)
