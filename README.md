# Falling Sand Sim

Falling soil 1.0, Terrestrial Assemblages (Summer 2023: Rikka Ly, Simon Ingram). This web app uses ideas and approaches from falling sand games and applies them to model a plant-microbial system where the user can add elements and learn something of their purpose in the system. Code was developed from a falling sand program found [here.](https://github.com/ObviousNonsense/FallingSand)

## Particle Types:
- VAPR: Vapour is evaporated water and falls like rain.
- WTR: Water is essential for life and helps plants grow. 
- SOIL: Soil is home to many organisms beneficial to plant growth - try placing some seeds and see what happens. 
- SEED: Seeds grow plants and flowers in the right conditions. As the roots grow so does its community of beneficial microbes and fungi. The white dashed hyphae extending from the roots can be found with almost any plant you pull out from the ground. This is an important fungi/plant relationship that uses the trading of sugars from the plant for beneficial nutrients. The pink microbes below need to be eaten by protozoa to release their nutrients - try placing some!
- MCRB: Microbes, each plant cultivates its own population of good bacteria, much like we do in our gut. These microbes fight off bad bacteria and collect hard-to-get nutrients that the plant can't break down. 
- PRTZ: Protozoa are the secondary predators in this ecosystem, they feast on microbes and excrete their nutrients for the plant - this isn't their entire purpose, but it's definitely a beneficial food chain for our plants! 
- BUGS: Bugs gobble up biomass created by decomposing plants to create organic fertiliser for the soil -  not only that, but protozoa are pretty tasty to them too. 
- NITR: Nitrogen or synthetic fertiliser is a great resource for growing plants but not so great to our soil life - the high salt content in these fertilisers sucks the moisture out of microbes and compacts the soil. Use with caution! 
- BIOM: Biomass has all the good nutrients to support a thriving soil ecosystem - when it is eaten by protozoa it becomes organic fertilizer.
- WALL: Walls provide an option to be creative - try creating a hanging garden or and irrigation system.
